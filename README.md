# ðŸ“± Mobile Tag Spec Generator

The **Mobile Tag Spec Generator** is a powerful tool designed to streamline the creation of tag specifications for the **Adobe Mobile SDK**. It allows users to dynamically generate payloads for `trackAction`, `trackState`, and `Edge.sendEvent` calls. By automating the generation of both iOS Swift and Android Java/Kotlin code snippets, the tool ensures accurate and efficient implementation, testing, and debugging of tracking events.

## ðŸ›  Features

1. **Dynamic Code Generation**:
   - Supports three key action types:
     - **`trackAction`**: Track user interactions like button clicks.
     - **`trackState`**: Track app states such as screens or pages.
     - **`Edge.sendEvent`**: Send custom XDM events to AEP.

2. **Multi-Language Support**:
   - Generates iOS Swift and Android Java/Kotlin code snippets.

3. **Key-Value Pair Customization**:
   - Allows users to define key-value pairs for tracking events.

4. **Intuitive UI**:
   - Modern, user-friendly design with copy-to-clipboard functionality.

5. **Accuracy and Efficiency**:
   - Reduces manual errors in implementation by providing pre-tested code.

## ðŸ›  Instructions for Use

1. **Select the Action Type**:
   - Choose between `trackAction`, `trackState`, or `Edge.sendEvent` using the dropdown menu.

2. **Add Key-Value Pairs**:
   - Enter the key (e.g., `page_name`) and value (e.g., `homepage`) for your event.
   - Map additional custom data points if necessary.

3. **View the Generated Code**:
   - The tool generates iOS Swift and Android Java/Kotlin code based on your inputs.

4. **Copy and Use the Code**:
   - Use the "Copy" buttons to quickly integrate the code into your mobile app.

5. **Reset or Modify**:
   - Reset the form to start over or modify the inputs to update the code dynamically.

### **`trackAction` Example (iOS Swift)**
```swift
let additionalData: [String: Any] = [
    "page_name": "homepage",
    "user_action": "button_click"
]
MobileCore.trackAction("button_click", data: additionalData)
